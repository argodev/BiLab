<H2>Bilab Quick-start</H2>
<P>The Bilab main window is comprised of distinct <B>views</B>. To
the left is the interactive <I>Console</I> view where scigol language
expressions and commands can be entered. The view in the lower right
is <I>Value</I> view (probably where you are reading this). It
displays values that have been selected in the <I>Environemt</I> view
above, or values evaluated using the <B>.show</B> console command. 
</P>
<P>The Environment view displays a hierarchical tree of the objects
available, such as functions that can be called, values of any type -
such as numbers, lists, molecules etc. Selecting an object in the
Environment view will cause its value to be display in the Value view
- invoking any special viewers that are available depending on the
type of the object. 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<H3>Entering Scigol expressions</H3>
<P>Try out some simple Scigol expressions in the console view: 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">3+(6*9)</PRE><P>
You should see the value of the result displayed. You can call
functions by enclusing their arguments (if any) within parenthesis
after their name:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sqrt(5)</PRE><P>
To see the type of the function (a <I>func</I> in Scigol parlance),
type:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">typeof(sqrt)</PRE><P>
The result you see:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">sqrt: func(r:real -&gt; real)</PRE><P>
is called the function's <I>signature</I>. In this case it reads: a
function taking a single parameter, named <B>r</B> &ndash; that is a
<B>real</B> number, and giving a <B>real</B> number in return. More
information about a function, or any object, may be obtained by
typing (for exampel):</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">.help sqrt</PRE><P>
You can also assign variables in the console as follows:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">s3 = sin(3)</PRE><P>
Notice that the value of the right-hand-side (RHS) expression was
displayed in addition to being assigned to the variable <B>s3</B>. To
suppress the display of expression evaluation, suffix the line with a
semi-conol '<B>;</B>'.</P>
<P>For example, suppose we want to assign the variable <B>z</B> to a
3-dimensional vector of zeros. There is a function named <I>zero</I>
that does just what we want:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">z = zero(3);</PRE><P>
The value of the expression (a <I>vector</I>) wasn't displayed. We
can easily display it by typing the variable alone as an expression:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">z</PRE><P>
By default, there are some sample objects in the global environment.
For example, there is a <B>list</B> of numbers named <I>gilist</I>
that has been predefined. To see its value just enter:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">gilist</PRE><P>
All lists in Scigol are represented by round parenthesis with comma
seperated elements. A <B>list</B> can contain any type of elements
and thet need not be all the same. A list can be indexed by using the
function call notation and passing the index as argument, like:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">gilist(0)</PRE><P>
You can also index ranges of list elements like this:</P>
<PRE>gilist(0..2)
gilist(0..-3)</PRE><P>
(Negative indices are counted from the end of the list instead of the
beginning)</P>
<P>There are many other types, such as <B>vector</B>, <B>matrix</B>,
<B>map</B>, <B>class</B> and others. Try some of these expressions:</P>
<PRE>v = [1 2 3]
v2 = [4 5 6]
v3 = v*2+v2
#v3
|v3|
zeromat = zero(2,2)
m1 = [1 2; 3 4]
m2 = [5 6; 7 8]
m1*m2+m2
mymap = [ 1 -&gt; 2; 2 -&gt; 4; 3 -&gt; &quot;thend&quot; ]
mymap(3)</PRE><H3>
Biological types</H3>
<P>By default, there are some sample object in the global
environment. For example, a DNA sequence named <B>d</B> has been
pre-defined. To view it simply enter it as an expression:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">d</PRE><P>
The variable d is an object of type <B>DNA</B>. As there is a custom
viewer available for DNA, the viewer has been displayed in-line in
the console (in this case it is an Artemis based viewer). 
</P>
<P><I>[*<B>NB</B>: in the current implementation there is only a
single viewer choice per type and there are no viewer menus or
options implemented]</I></P>
<P>There is also a pre-defined variable p containing a protein
sequence:</P>
<PRE>p
avgisomass(p)</PRE><P>
The <B>genbank</B> function takes a NCBI Genbank GI number, or list
of GI numbers, and retrieves their sequences from the internet. Try
this:</P>
<PRE>d3 = genbank( gilist(3) )
#d3</PRE><P>
You can transcribe that into RNA thus:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">r3 = transcribe(d3);</PRE><P>
or directly into a protein (1<SUP>st</SUP> frame):</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">p3 = translate(d3)</PRE><P>
While this protein has no structure information, a predefined sample
protein with strucutre is declared as variable p2:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">p2</PRE><P>
As you can see, there is a custom viewer (based on JMol) for protein
molecules.</P>
<H3>Alignments</H3>
<P>Suppose you have a set of protein sequences that you'd like to run
through the <B>ClustalW</B> program to obtain an alignment. You can
type the following to run ClustalW on proteins <B>p</B>, the
translation of DNA <B>d2</B> and protein dequence <B>p3</B>; first
put them into a list and then invoke the <B>clustalw</B> function <I>(or
simply type the list directly as the argument to the function)</I>:</P>
<PRE>slist = ( p, translate(d2), p3 )
clustalw(slist)</PRE><P>
The result of the function is an <B>alignment</B> &ndash; another
Bilab type. The result is also displayed in a custom viewer for
alignments (JalView based).</P>
<H3>Learning about the library</H3>
<P>The easiest way to learn about the available functions and object
in the Bilab library is to browse using the Environment view and to
get help on functions using the .help command. Many functions has
extensive help available. For example:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">.help antigenic</PRE><P>
<BR><BR>
</P>
<P><I>[*<B>NB</B>: Very little help text has been written in the
current Bilab implementation prototype]</I></P>
