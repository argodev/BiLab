// There are two formats for notebook files. Both are XML files with
// a similar structure. The first is a normal XML file containing all
// the information contained in the notebook.
// The second is a similar XML file, but with its bytes specially
// laid-out (via padding with white-space). It also contains some
// extra attributed on some elements with file byte offset hints
// to aid in quickly seeking to specific elements.
// These 'random access structured' notebook files can be directly
// modified, in-place, efficiently by this implementation. They
// are marked as such via the RandomAccess="true" attribute of the
// top-level notebook element.
// If this class is constructed with a File that is not of the RandomAccess
// type, it will be re-written as such first.
