 * <dd>position of first base in the first occurrence of the repeated segment
 * <dt>end
 * <dd>position of the last base in first occurence of the repeated segment
 * <dt>label
 * <dd>Currently, usually a textual description of the repeating segment, but
 * can refer to a labeled repeat_unit feature. This attribute may in future
 * become a proper DbXref to a feature;
