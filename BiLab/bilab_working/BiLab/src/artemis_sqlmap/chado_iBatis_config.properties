# This is just a simple properties file that simplifies automated configuration 
# of the SQL Maps configuration file (e.g. by Ant builds or continuous  
# integration tools for different environments... etc.) 
# These values can be used in any property value in the file above (e.g. ${driver}) 
# Using a properties file such as this is completely optional.
